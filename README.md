This spreadsheet contains responses collected from first responders in the UK in 2023.

The survey covers perspectives from any member of the emergency services that has experience of rescuing members of the public from potentially life-threatening situations, where they supposedly need the public to comply with their instructions relatively quickly to avoid the risk they are facing. 
Including professionals who are actively rescuing people from different types of dangerous situations, which are possibly life-threatening, will allow us to find shared patterns in terms of:
 - The key characteristics of the messages they use to deliver vital clear information to people in risk
 - The strategies they use to establish trust quickly with people they do not know and need to comply with their instructions whilst in a stressful and dangerous condition.
